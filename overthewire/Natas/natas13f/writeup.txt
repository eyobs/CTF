=>what this level differes from the previous one is that it included a check for file type 
	exif_imagetype() -> this function return +ve number if the file given is an image type
			 -> what the function does is check the magic number of the file uploaded
				->so if we add an images magic number to the file we are uploading
				  we can bypass it!
=>so uploading the already made file("shell.jpg") by changing the random name on the request
to .php and accessing it gives us a shell! eg ?cmd=ls
				?cmd=cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13
