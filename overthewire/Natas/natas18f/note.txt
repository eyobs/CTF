=>HTTP is a stateless protocol. A stateless protocol does not require the server to retain 
information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests. But some web 
applications may have to track the user's progress from page to page, for example when a web 
server is required to customize the content of a web page for a user. 
Solutions for these cases include:
        * the use of HTTP cookies.
        * server side sessions,
        * hidden variables (when the current page contains a form), and
        * URL-rewriting using URI-encoded parameters, e.g., /index.php?session_id=some_unique_session_code.

Session variables solve this problem by storing user information to be used across multiple 
pages (e.g. username, favorite color, etc). By default, session variables last until the user 
closes the browser.        
* A session is a way to store information (in variables) to be used across multiple pages.
  Unlike a cookie, the information is not stored on the users computer.

=>A session is started with the session_start() function.
Session variables are set with the PHP global variable: $_SESSION.
=>$_SESSION : all session variable values are stored in the global $_SESSION variable
